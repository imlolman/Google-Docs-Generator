2. **Select Template**: Choose a Google Document template to serve as your base. Ensure your template uses variable placeholders in the format of `{{variable name}}`. For example, you can see our [Sample Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nBHaNBWrudTFliQExdY2SDz1dEJwELerEP8GgBmkgC4/edit?usp=sharing).

Starting from the second row, new documents will be generated. The first column should be used for filenames. For reference, check our [Sample Excel Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wmMLXyhaQ-va0ms6AeNjD6imh2ILDgRUW7DcpmpNUBg/edit?usp=share_link).
